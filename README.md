### Specifying a layout for your blog
By default, nxtblog.ai uses the root layout of your project to render the blog to make sure it has the same styles as the rest of your website.
If you do not have a root layout in your project that specifies styles such as font color and page layout, we recommend creating a blog specific layout that specifies these styles. To do this create a new file in your project under /app/\<your-blog-path>/layout.tsx. For example, If your path is /blog, create a file at /app/blog/layout.tsx. This file could look like this:

```tsx 
// Path: /app/blog/layout.tsx
export default function BlogLayout({ children }: {
    children: React.ReactNode
}) {
    return (
        <main className="bg-black text-white">
            {children}
        </main>
    )
}
```

Install the package using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install nxtblog-ai --save
```

### pnpm
```bash
pnpm install nxtblog-ai
```

### yarn
```bash
yarn add nxtblog-ai
```

## Setup

### Step 1: Get your Project Key
Sign into your [nxtblog.ai](https://nxtblog.ai) account and create a new project. You can get your project key from the project dashboard.

### Step 2: Initialize nxtblog.ai in Your Next.js Project
Use your project key to initialize nxtblog.ai in your Next.js project. After installing the package, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
npx nxtblog-ai init --project-key <your-project-key>
```
This will create a new dynamic route in your Next.js app where your blog posts will be published with our prebuilt components. It will use the route you specified when creating your project. If you chose "/blog", it will create a new route /blog/[articlePath] where your blog posts will be published.

### Step 3: Enable Image Support (Optional)
To enable images in your blog posts, add the following to your next.config.js file to allow our CDN to serve the images to your server.
```javascript
// next.config.js
const config = {
    // ... your other next options ...
    images: {
        remotePatterns: [
            {
                protocol: "https",
                hostname: "nxtblog.ai",
                pathname: "/api/cdn/**"
            }
        ]
    }
};

export default config;
```

### Step 3: Step 3: Add Your Project Key
Add your project key and the CDN URL to your .env file (or whatever method you use to manage your environment variables). You can find the CDN URL in your project dashboard.
    
```bash
# .env
# ... your other env variables ...
NEXT_ARTICLE_CDN_URL="https://nxtblog.ai/api/cdn"
NEXT_ARTICLE_PROJECT_KEY=your-project-key-here
```

Thatâ€™s it! Youâ€™re fully setup to generate SEO-optimized articles for your blog in our dashboard. They will be published in real time to your Next.js application.
